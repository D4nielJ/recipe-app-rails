![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app it allows you to make them public so anyone can access them.
